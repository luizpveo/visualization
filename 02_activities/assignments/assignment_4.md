# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/).
Dataset: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/tcdsb-schools/
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.

- For each visualization, describe and justify:

    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    Python
    
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    Parents that are looking for schools in Toronto
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    Showing the numbers of school by level ( E â€“ Elementary S â€“ Secondary AL â€“ Adult Learning  ADM â€“ Administration Building) and the number of schools by municipality
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?
    I tried to use simple and clean visualizations
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I would share my code and I would ensure that the data I use is accessible to anyone
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I would use colorblind-Friendly palettes and descriptive Labels
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    Parents that are looking for schools in differents Municipals 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?
    I tried to find the primary questions or insights
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    It took some time to determine which libraries I would need to create this visualization. In the end, I used Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and Seaborn

    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    Tableau Public
    
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    Parents that are looking for schools in Toronto
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    I created a visualization that shows the number of schools by each zip code in the city of Toronto
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?
    I tried to use simple and clean visualizations
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    I would share my Tableau file and I would ensure that the data I use is accessible to anyone
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    My visualization has interactive elements like filters that provide additional information (type of School) 
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    Parents that are looking for schools in differents Municipals 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?
    I tried to find the primary questions or insights
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    It took some time to performing initial data exploration to understand patterns, distributions, and anomalies

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
